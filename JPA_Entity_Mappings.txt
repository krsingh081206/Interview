### 1. `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` Annotations

**Question**: You are tasked with designing a `Blog` and `Post` entity where a blog can have multiple posts, and each post belongs to one blog. Explain how you would set up the relationship using `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` annotations. How would you manage the bidirectional relationship?

**Answer**:
To set up a `Blog` and `Post` entity with a one-to-many relationship, we use `@OneToMany` in the `Blog` entity and `@ManyToOne` in the `Post` entity. This setup allows each `Blog` to have multiple `Post` entities.

**Sample Code**:
```java
@Entity
public class Blog {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String title;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "blog", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
    private List<Post> posts = new ArrayList<>();

    // Getters and Setters
    public void addPost(Post post) {
        posts.add(post);
        post.setBlog(this);
    }

    public void removePost(Post post) {
        posts.remove(post);
        post.setBlog(null);
    }
}

@Entity
public class Post {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String content;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "blog_id")
    private Blog blog;

    // Getters and Setters
}
```
In the `Blog` class, the `mappedBy` attribute indicates that the `Blog` is not the owner of the relationship; `Post` is. The `Blog` class also manages the association through methods like `addPost` and `removePost` to keep the bidirectional relationship consistent.

**Follow-up**: How would you fetch a `Blog` entity along with its posts eagerly?

**Answer**:
You can fetch a `Blog` entity along with its posts eagerly using the `@OneToMany` annotation with `fetch = FetchType.EAGER` or by using a `JOIN FETCH` query.

**Sample Code**:
```java
@Entity
public class Blog {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String title;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "blog", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private List<Post> posts = new ArrayList<>();
    // Other fields and methods
}

// Using a JOIN FETCH query
public Blog findBlogWithPosts(Long blogId) {
    return entityManager.createQuery(
        "SELECT b FROM Blog b LEFT JOIN FETCH b.posts WHERE b.id = :id", Blog.class)
        .setParameter("id", blogId)
        .getSingleResult();
}
```

### 2. `@ManyToMany` Annotation

**Question**: You need to design a `Student` and `Course` entity where each student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students. Describe how you would implement this many-to-many relationship using JPA annotations. What table structure will this result in?

**Answer**:
To set up a many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`, we use the `@ManyToMany` annotation in both entities. A join table is used to manage the relationship between the two entities.

**Sample Code**:
```java
@Entity
public class Student {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(
        name = "student_course",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id"))
    private Set<Course> courses = new HashSet<>();

    // Getters and Setters
}

@Entity
public class Course {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String title;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "courses")
    private Set<Student> students = new HashSet<>();

    // Getters and Setters
}
```
This setup will result in a join table named `student_course` with two columns: `student_id` and `course_id`, each acting as a foreign key pointing to the `Student` and `Course` tables respectively.

**Follow-up**: How would you prevent duplicate entries in the join table, ensuring a student cannot enroll in the same course multiple times?

**Answer**:
The `Set` collection used in the mapping ensures that each combination of `Student` and `Course` is unique, preventing duplicate entries. The `Set` data structure inherently does not allow duplicates.

**Sample Code**:
```java
// This prevents adding duplicate Course entries for a Student
public void addCourse(Course course) {
    this.courses.add(course);
    course.getStudents().add(this);
}

public void removeCourse(Course course) {
    this.courses.remove(course);
    course.getStudents().remove(this);
}
```

### 3. Bidirectional vs Unidirectional Relationships

**Question**: Compare and contrast bidirectional and unidirectional relationships in JPA. Provide an example scenario where a unidirectional `@OneToMany` relationship might be more appropriate than a bidirectional one.

**Answer**:
In JPA, a bidirectional relationship is one where both entities have references to each other. In contrast, a unidirectional relationship means only one entity knows about the relationship.

**Bidirectional Example**:
```java
// Blog and Post with bidirectional @OneToMany/@ManyToOne
@Entity
public class Blog {
    // Fields and methods, including a List<Post> with @OneToMany annotation
}

@Entity
public class Post {
    // Fields and methods, including a Blog field with @ManyToOne annotation
}
```

**Unidirectional Example**:
```java
// Blog with unidirectional @OneToMany
@Entity
public class Blog {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String title;

    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
    @JoinColumn(name = "blog_id") // Join column is on the Post table
    private List<Post> posts = new ArrayList<>();

    // Getters and Setters
}

@Entity
public class Post {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String content;

    // No reference back to Blog
}
```

**Scenario**: A unidirectional `@OneToMany` relationship might be more appropriate if the child entity (`Post` in this case) does not need to reference its parent (`Blog`). For example, if the application only needs to display posts within the context of their blog and there's no need for the post to know its blog, a unidirectional setup simplifies the design.

**Advantages of Unidirectional**:
- Simplifies the child entity.
- Reduces complexity and potentially decreases memory usage.

**Advantages of Bidirectional**:
- Both entities are aware of the relationship, making navigation between them easier.
- Useful for operations that require awareness of both sides of the relationship.

### 4. Cascade Types and Orphan Removal

**Question**: Explain the role of cascade types and the `orphanRemoval` attribute in JPA. How would you use them in a `@OneToMany` relationship? Provide an example involving `Library` and `Book` entities where deleting a `Library` also deletes its `Books`.

**Answer**:
Cascade types determine the operations that should be propagated from the parent entity to the related child entities. The `orphanRemoval` attribute allows for the automatic removal of child entities when they are no longer referenced by the parent.

**Sample Code**:
```java
@Entity
public class Library {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
    private List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();

    // Getters and Setters

    public void addBook(Book book) {
        books.add(book);
        book.setLibrary(this);
    }

    public void removeBook(Book book) {
        books.remove(book);
        book.setLibrary(null);
    }
}

@Entity
public class Book {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String title;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "library_id")
    private Library library;

    // Getters and Setters
}
```
In this setup, when a `Library` is deleted, all associated `Book` entities are also deleted due to the `CascadeType.ALL` setting. If a `Book` is removed from the `books` list in the `Library`, it is also deleted from the database due to `orphanRemoval = true`.

**Follow-up**: How would you modify this setup to prevent the automatic deletion of books when a library is deleted but still allow books to be deleted if removed from the library's list?

**Answer**:
You can remove `CascadeType.REMOVE` from the cascade settings, keeping only `orphanRemoval = true`.

 This way, books will not be deleted when the library is deleted, but they will be removed if they are no longer referenced by the library.

**Sample Code**:
```java
@Entity
public class Library {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @OneToMany(orphanRemoval = true)
    private List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();

    // Methods remain the same
}
```

### 5. Managing `@ManyToOne` Relationships with Composite Keys

**Question**: Suppose you need to create a `Student` and `Enrollment` entity where `Enrollment` tracks which courses a student is enrolled in. An enrollment is identified by a composite key consisting of the `studentId` and `courseId`. How would you set up this relationship using JPA?

**Answer**:
You can use the `@IdClass` annotation to represent the composite key and map the relationship using `@ManyToOne` in the `Enrollment` entity.

**Sample Code**:
```java
@Entity
@IdClass(EnrollmentId.class)
public class Enrollment {

    @Id
    private Long studentId;

    @Id
    private Long courseId;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "studentId", insertable = false, updatable = false)
    private Student student;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "courseId", insertable = false, updatable = false)
    private Course course;

    // Other fields and methods
}

@Entity
public class Student {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "student")
    private Set<Enrollment> enrollments = new HashSet<>();

    // Getters and Setters
}

@Entity
public class Course {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String title;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "course")
    private Set<Enrollment> enrollments = new HashSet<>();

    // Getters and Setters
}

public class EnrollmentId implements Serializable {
    private Long studentId;
    private Long courseId;

    // Getters, Setters, hashCode, equals
}
```
In this setup, the `Enrollment` entity uses a composite key consisting of `studentId` and `courseId`. The `@IdClass` annotation specifies that these fields together form the primary key for `Enrollment`.

**Follow-up**: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using composite keys in JPA?

**Answer**:

**Advantages**:
- Can represent natural relationships that don't require an artificial key.
- Provides more meaningful and self-explanatory identifiers.

**Disadvantages**:
- Can complicate query construction and entity management.
- Handling composite keys in relationships can increase complexity compared to single, autogenerated keys.
