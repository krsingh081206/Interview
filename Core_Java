Candidate was not able to comprehend the problem statement even after explaining multiple times.

Multi-Attribute Sorting
========================

Write a program to sort a list of Students according to the student name and secondly, sort according to student age.

Before Sorting:
Input
======
Student{Name=Ajay, Age=27}
Student{Name=Sneha, Age=23}
Student{Name=Simran, Age=37}
Student{Name=Ajay, Age=22}
Student{Name=Ajay, Age=29}
Student{Name=Sneha, Age=22}

Output
=======
After Sorting:

Student{Name=Ajay, Age=22}
Student{Name=Ajay, Age=27}
Student{Name=Ajay, Age=29}
Student{Name=Simran, Age=37}
Student{Name=Sneha, Age=22}
Student{Name=Sneha, Age=23}

Code Snippet
=============
Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
    .filter(s -> {
        System.out.println("filter: " + s);
        return true;
    })
    .forEach(s -> System.out.println("forEach: " + s));

Scenario #1
Suppose you have 2 threads (Thread-1 and Thread-2) on same object. 
Thread-1 is in synchronized method1(), can Thread-2 enter synchronized method2() at same time? 

class Test {

public synchronized method1(){}


public synchronized method2(){}
}

Scenario #2
Suppose you have 2 threads (Thread-1 and Thread-2) on same object. 
Thread-1 is in static synchronized method1(), can Thread-2 enter synchronized method2() at same time?

class Test {

public static synchronized method1(){}


public synchronized method2(){}
}

Scenario #3
Suppose you have 2 threads (Thread-1 and Thread-2) on same object. 
Thread-1 is in static synchronized method1(), can Thread-2 enter static synchronized method2() at same time?
class Test {

public static synchronized method1(){}


public static synchronized method2(){}

#############################
Let us say we have a directory of files with different extensions (.java,.c,.py,.go,.tf,.kt).
Write a program to sort it by programming language name.

Sample input 
{python=.py, c++=.cpp, java=.java, golang=.go, kotlin=.kt, terraform=.tf}

Sample output
