Write a program that creates a concordance of characters occurring in a string
(i.e., which characters occur where in a string). Read the string from the command
line.Here is an example of how to run the program:
>java Concordance HelloWorld
{d=[9], o=[4, 6], r=[7], W=[5], H=[0], l=[2, 3, 8], e=[1]}
